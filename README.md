# Hello, I'm datadotlog


## About Me

Hey there, folks! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Datadotlog, also known as FÃ¡bio when I'm not in cyber mode. I'm a student with a passion for cybersecurity, navigating to the deepest oceans of bits and bytes.

## Cybersecurity in My DNA

Even though I'm in the early stages of my dive into the cybersecurity realm, I can assure you that cybersecurity is more than a career choice for meâ€”it's practically my kind of digital blood. Lines of code run in my veins, and firewalls are my second home.

## Flipper Zero Fanatic

I recently got my hands on the Flipper Zero because, let's be honest, we don't all have unlimited budgets for high-end tools. But hey, it's surprisingly powerful and gets the job done! ðŸ’»ðŸ”’

## Magical Scripts ðŸš€

I even crafted some magical scripts for the Flipper Zero. Check out my Flipper Security Toolkit repository for some cybersecurity wizardry in action.
